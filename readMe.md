# SIMPLE IRRIGATION SYS

## Working

The project contains two tanks(Working tank & Resevoir tank). Both tanks are filled with water. Whenever water level in the working tank decreases below the limit, water is pumped from resevoir into working tank.
I had soil moisture sensor fixed in soil containing plants to monitor moisture level.

The moisture level is to be maintained. In case the level drops below the limit, water is pumped from working tank to the plants

## Components used

1. 5V pump --> 2
2. Ultrasonic sensor
3. Soil moisture sensor
4. Arduino nano
5. 9V battery
